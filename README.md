# LSTM Stock Price Prediction Model
## Overview

### This repository contains a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model implemented in Python for predicting stock prices. The model leverages historical stock price data to forecast future prices, utilizing the capabilities of recurrent neural networks to capture time-series patterns.

Features
- LSTM Architecture: Uses LSTM neural networks to predict stock prices.
- Data Preprocessing: Handles normalization and preparation of stock data.
- Model Training: Trains on historical data to learn patterns.
- Price Prediction: Generates future stock price predictions.
- Visualization: Plots actual vs. predicted prices.
